# Student Evaluation app

For the final assignment at [Codaisseur](https://codaisseur.com) we had to make an application that allowed teachers
to evaluation students.

To complete this task we had 3,5 days and it was an individual project.

___

With this application a teacher can:
* Add a class
* Add a student to the class
* Edit the student
* Delete the student
* Add evaluations for the student
* Pick a 'random' student from the class to ask a question.

___

To get a 'random' student we had to write an [algorithm](https://github.com/nsch1/evaluation-client/blob/master/src/randomStudent.js)
which picks a student based on the result of their last evaluation.
